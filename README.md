**Hereâ€™s a concise description of the project:**<br>

**Project Title:** <br>
Analyzing and Predicting Environmental Protection Expenditure.

**Objective:**<br>
This project analyzes environmental protection expenditure data from 2009 to 2022 to identify trends and predict future spending. The goal is to understand how environmental expenditure has evolved and forecast future trends to assist policymakers.

**Dataset:**<br>
The dataset includes records of expenditure by different sectors (e.g., Central Government) from 2009 to 2022. It contains columns for year, sector, expenditure value, and type of expenditure.

**Methodology:**<br>
1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and inspect the dataset.<br>
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends using line charts, histograms, and pie charts to understand spending patterns.<br>
3.Predictive Modeling: Build a linear regression model to predict future expenditures (2023-2030).

**Results:**<br>
1.Trends show consistent growth in environmental expenditure.<br>
2.The model predicts continued growth in future years, with expected increases in expenditure.
